        <h2>Gaelynn Lea Performance and “Accessibility in the Arts” Talk</h2>
        <p>In January 2020, we invited Gaelynn Lea to campus to perform her music and deliver a talk on “Accessibility in the Arts.” Gaelynn Lea won NPR Music’s Tiny Desk Contest in 2016, and she’s been on the road ever since playing her unique mix of haunting original songs and traditional fiddle tunes. So far the singer-songwriter and violinist has appeared in 43 states and 7 countries – she’s graced the stage of renowned venues like Nashville’s Music City Roots, The Kennedy Center and House of Blues Chicago. Lea performs from her electric wheelchair. She began playing the violin 25 years ago after a creative music teacher helped her to adapt a playing style that suits her frame. Lea holds her instrument like a tiny cello and loops her classically trained rhythms and melodies with her Memory Man pedal to create a “symphonic cacophony that is both glorious in its reach and profoundly introspective,” Her original songs explore the contrasting nature of existence – dark and light, birth and death, anger and forgiveness, sorrow and joy. In addition to performing and recording, Lea also does speaking engagements about disability rights, finding inner freedom, and accessibility in the arts. In recent years, she has used her music as a platform to advocate for people with disabilities and to promote positive social change.

        <h2>Disability Day of Mourning</h2>
        <p>Every year on March 1st since 2012, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN) has led members of the disability community in an annual vigil remembering disabled individuals who have been victims of filicide. In March 2019, we hosted Ann Arbor’s first Disability Day of Mourning.</p>
